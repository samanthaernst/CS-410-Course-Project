# CourseProject:  r/AmItheAsshole Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This program takes the link to a r/AmItheAsshole post and renders a color-coded word cloud based on sentiment analysis (negative/neutral/positive each corresponding to a certain color), a bar graph with the top emotions in replies, and another bar graph of the percentage of each of the 5 possible judgments. In a subreddit as controversial and divided as AITA, this program gives users an overview so that they can see at a glance what the majority of commenters are thinking and feeling. It can be used by casual viewers and avid readers of the subreddit alike.
